# EVEYES 360: Multi-Disciplinary Digital Fluid & Edema Monitoring 🛡️

### 🌍 The Vision: Transforming Fluid Management
Fluid overload (Edema) is the "silent alarm" for the most critical medical conditions. **EVEYES 360** is a specialized AI-powered platform designed to detect these shifts before they turn into emergencies. By digitizing the inverse correlation between **Body Weight** and **Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA)**, we provide a life-saving early warning system for high-risk patients.

### 🏥 Clinical Use Cases:
- **OBGYN / Pregnancy:** Early detection of **Preeclampsia** and **Eclampsia** risks by monitoring edema caused by hypoproteinemia. A digital safety net for mother and baby.
- **Nephrology:** Real-time fluid load tracking for **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** and dialysis patients to prevent pulmonary congestion.
- **Cardiology:** Proactive management of **Heart Failure** to stop the "revolving door" of hospital readmissions due to dyspnea.

### 🚀 Key Technical Features:
- **Condition-Specific AI Logic:** Tailored risk analysis for Pregnancy, Kidney, and Heart conditions.
- **Visual Biomarker Integration:** Tracking BIA (Ohm Ω) vs. Weight (kg) trends with precision.
- **Automated Clinical Reports:** One-click PDF generation for direct physician oversight.
- **Responsive Web-App Architecture:** Full mobile functionality via any smartphone browser.

### 💰 Impact
- **Saves Lives:** Detection of pre-symptomatic fluid shifts.
- **Reduces Costs:** Minimizes unnecessary ER visits and long-term hospital stays.
- **Empowers Patients:** Professional-grade monitoring in the comfort of home.
