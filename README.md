# EVEYES 360: AI-Powered Remote Monitoring for Heart Failure 🏥

### 💡 The Vision
Heart failure remains one of the primary drivers of hospitalization costs in aging populations. Recurring admissions due to edema (fluid retention) and dyspnea (shortness of breath) strain healthcare budgets and reduce patient quality of life. **EVEYES 360** aims to bridge the gap between hospital and home.

### 🚀 The Solution
Our system provides a non-invasive, AI-driven monitoring suite that helps patients stay at home while staying connected to their doctors. 

#### Key Features:
- **Visual Biomarker Analysis:** AI-based facial and body analysis via smartphone camera to detect early signs of physical distress and fluid retention.
- **BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) Integration:** Tracking body composition and impedance changes to monitor internal fluid shifts before they become critical.
- **Early Warning System:** Real-time data sync with healthcare providers to prevent emergency admissions through proactive intervention.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Significantly reduces the "readmission cycle" costs for national healthcare systems.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **AI/ML:** Mediapipe, OpenCV (Visual Analysis)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Doctor/Patient Dashboard)
- **Data Science:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Deployment:** Docker / Streamlit Cloud
